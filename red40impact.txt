Abstract:
Concern that synthetic food dyes may impact behavior in children prompted a review by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA).
OEHHA conducted a systematic review of the epidemiologic research on synthetic food dyes and neurobehavioral outcomes in children with or without identified behavioral disorders (particularly attention and activity).
We also conducted a search of the animal toxicology literature to identify studies of neurobehavioral effects in laboratory animals exposed to synthetic food dyes.
Finally, we conducted a hazard characterization of the potential neurobehavioral impacts of food dye consumption.
We identified 27 clinical trials of children exposed to synthetic food dyes in this review, of which 25 were challenge studies.
All studies used a cross-over design and most were double blinded and the cross-over design was randomized.
Sixteen (64%) out of 25 challenge studies identified some evidence of a positive association, and in 13 (52%) the association was statistically significant.
These studies support a relationship between food dye exposure and adverse behavioral outcomes in children.
Animal toxicology literature provides additional support for effects on behavior.
Together, the human clinical trials and animal toxicology literature support an association between synthetic food dyes and behavioral impacts in children.
The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acceptable daily intakes are based on older studies that were not designed to assess the types of behavioral effects observed in children.
For four dyes where adequate dose-response data from animal and human studies were available, comparisons of the effective doses in studies that measured behavioral or brain effects following exposure to synthetic food dyes indicate that the basis of the ADIs may not be adequate to protect neurobehavior in susceptible children.
There is a need to re-evaluate exposure in children and for additional research to provide a more complete database for establishing ADIs protective of neurobehavioral effects.

Background
Concerns about possible associations between exposure to synthetic food dyes and the exacerbation of symptoms of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children have surfaced periodically since the 1970s.
The concern prompted the California legislature to request a review by the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) of available studies to evaluate whether the synthetic food dyes currently allowed in foods and medications in the United States impact neurobehavior in children [1].
This paper provides an overview of key portions of OEHHA’s peer-reviewed assessment, specifically the evaluation of the clinical trials of synthetic food dyes in children and available animal toxicology studies, as well as discussion of our hazard characterization and the possible public health implications of our findings.
Our evaluation focused on seven of the nine food dyes subject to FD&C batch certification by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and approved for general use in food in the US (Table 1).
These seven dyes contribute nearly all of the exposure to synthetic food dyes for the general US public [1].
The term “FD&C batch-certified” refers to the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act requirements for chemical analysis of each manufactured batch of food dye to ensure that specific contaminants are present below legal limits.
OEHHA evaluated the literature to determine whether there is any evidence supporting the association of exposure to synthetic food dyes with adverse neurobehavioral impacts in children in the general population with or without a diagnosis of ADHD.
Methods
The literature review methods were designed to identify all the literature most relevant to the assessment of evidence on the neurological or neurobehavioral effects of the synthetic food dyes listed in Table 1.
The search was executed to identify peer-reviewed open-source and proprietary journal articles, print and digital books, reports, and gray literature that potentially reported relevant toxicological and epidemiological information.
We also included Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B/CI Acid Orange in the search terms since these food dyes are part of anoverlapping literature that might contain information on the commonly used FD&C synthetic food dyes.
PubMed MeSH browser (PubMed MeSH browser) and PubChem were used to identify subject headings, other index terms and synonyms for the food dyes of interest and their metabolites, as well as for the concepts related to exposure, food, mechanisms of action, and neurological outcomes.
Preliminary searches were run and results reviewed to identify additional terms.
The concepts were combined in the following manner:

The detailed search strategy executed in PubMed on
November 26, 2018 is summarized in the additional
information (Table A.1). This search was run again to
capture literature updates, on March 8, 2019 and April
22, 2019, and again in October 2020.
Additional databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus)
and other data sources (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Journal, EFSA Scientific Output, US FDA
Safety Information Office, University of California, San
Francisco Food Industry Documents Archive, and Dyes
and Pigments Journal) were also searched; strategies
were tailored according to the search features unique
to each database and data source. Relevant literature
was also identified from citations in individual articles.
In addition, we searched NIH RePort to identify additional unpublished clinical trials or animal research.
In our systematic review of the epidemiologic research
on synthetic food dyes and neurobehavioral outcomes
in children, we summarized the major strengths and
weaknesses of each study, described any consistencies
across study results, and if heterogeneity exists, identified its sources as far as possible [1].
Our epidemiologic review focused on clinical trials.
A major advantage of this type of study is that investigators generally have control over the exposure which
can help reduce bias and confounding compared to
other study designs. Next, we conducted systematic
evaluations of study methods and quality to ensure an
emphasis on the high quality studies for our conclusions. In evaluating study quality, we utilized criteria
based on the National Toxicology Program’s OHAT
Risk of Bias Rating Tool [2]. We modified these to be
specific to randomized clinical trials (RCT) on artificial food dyes and childhood neurobehavior. We examined several key characteristics of each study to assess
study quality including design, participant selection,
exposure levels, age groups, washout period, infractions, outcome metric, and funding (Table A.2). This
table also includes key information on results including statistical significance, effect size, dose-response,
and subgroups. The coding used in our statistical analyses and quality scoring is provided in Tables A.3 and
A.4. These tables show the criteria used to evaluate
study quality, which included randomization, placebo
use, dropout rate, blinding, whether dose-response
was assessed, outcome metric validation, replication,
and adequate washout. All this information was considered in making our overall conclusions about the
human study results.

In determining whether the study reported an association, we define association as either a statistically significant outcome (p value <.05 or 95% confidence intervals
that excluded 1.0 for relative risk estimates or 0 for mean
differences) or an effect size ≥20% or standardized effect
size ≥0.20. Most studies involved small sample sizes
and thus may not have had sufficient statistical power to
identify effects that are relatively small but still of public
health importance. Because of this, in addition to statistical significance, bias and effect size were also considered
in our evaluations of association and causal inference.
There are several arguments against solely using statistical significance to identify associations [3, 4].
We searched the animal toxicology literature and identified numerous studies of neurobehavioral effects in
laboratory animals exposed to synthetic food dyes. These
included studies of exposures during prenatal, infant,
and juvenile development, examining neurobehavioral
effects in the offspring manifest during development and/
or later in adult animals. The availability of studies at different developmental stages allowed a comprehensive
review of adverse developmental effects, although it limited the ability to compare results across study designs,
as exposures during different developmental stages may
manifest differently later in life. The OEHHA report
reviewed all available studies and provided strengths and
limitations for the individual studies [1].
Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADIs) for synthetic food dyes
were established by the US FDA between the 1960s and
the1980s based on general toxicology studies. OEHHA
therefore also evaluated whether newer studies that
included neurobehavioral assessment would be useful
for developing updated acceptable exposure levels that
explicitly account for and protect against neurobehavioral effects of individual food dyes. OEHHA compared the
results of those specific studies to the existing US FDA
ADIs, as well as ADIs developed by the Joint FAO/WHO
Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).

Results
Review of clinical trial studies

In total, 27 clinical trials were identified that met each of
the following criteria:
1. Human study
2. Clinical trial design
3. Participants were given a known quantity of synthetic food dyes or a diet low in or eliminating synthetic food dyes
4. A neurobehavioral outcome related to hyperactivity
or inattention was assessed
5. The majority of participants were children ≤19 years
of age

Page 3 of 19

6. The effects of an active ingredient or elimination diet
were compared to those of a placebo
Studies were excluded if they were:
1. Studies involving cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional designs
2. Studies that assessed the effects of a broad range of
food groups, including elimination studies, and did
not specifically evaluate synthetic food dyes. Any
effect identified in such studies would be difficult to
ascribe specifically to synthetic food dyes.
No exclusions were made based on the number of participants, participation rates, blinding, randomization, or
source (e.g., government reports), although each of these
factors was considered in our review of study quality and
in our overall conclusions.
Figure 1 presents the results of our literature search
as the number of clinical studies reporting adverse neurobehavioral outcomes by key study variables. Of the 27
studies meeting our criteria for inclusion, 25 involved
challenge studies, which we consider most relevant as
they directly challenge children with food dyes, and two
involved diet elimination studies. Detailed descriptions
of the 25 included challenge studies are provided in Table
A.2. Table 2 below summarizes the characteristics and
overall findings of the reviewed challenge studies. Several
studies of exposure to dye mixtures also included other
dyes not used in the US.
The most frequent study locations were in the US
(44%), followed by the UK (22%), and Australia and Canada (15% each). The mean number of participants was
44 (range 1–297). All studies used cross-over designs. In
the cross-over design, each subject receives each treatment (including placebo) and, thus, the subjects serve as
their own controls, which minimizes bias and confounding. Most challenge studies were double-blinded and
the cross-over design was randomized, although in two
studies the use of blinding was unclear. Randomization
was either not done or was unclear in seven studies. Six
studies assessed tartrazine only, whereas the rest studied mixtures of common dyes. The average dose assessed
was 55.8 mg/day (range 1.2 to 250 mg/day, doses relevant
to children’s exposure in the US). In all but one challenge
study, participants were placed on an elimination diet
during the study. Most studies (70%) used a validated or
otherwise commonly accepted metric to assess neurobehavioral outcomes, with the most common being the
Conners Parent scale.
Sixteen (64%) out of 25 challenge studies identified some evidence of an association and in 13 (52%),
the association was statistically significant (Fig. 1 and

Fig. 1 Number of clinical studies reporting positive associations by key study variables

Table 2; Table A.2). Associations (either large effect
sizes or statistically significant results) were most
commonly identified in studies that assessed neurobehavioral outcomes using information from the child’s
parents. Out of eight challenge studies that provided
results for both parents and teachers, four found associations only when examining parent reports [5–8], one
found associations for both parent and teacher reports
[9], two did not report an association for any outcome
metric [10, 11], and one found an association only for
another metric [12].
Positive associations were also more frequently
reported in studies published after the year 1990 (83.3 vs.
57.9%, p = 0.26), in studies that used validated metrics for
assessing outcome (70.6 vs. 50.0%, p = 0.17) and in studies with larger numbers of participants (see Fig. 1 and
Table 2). The reason why more recent studies tended to
report associations compared to earlier studies is unclear.
While two positive studies tested mixes of dyes plus
preservatives [13, 14], the large majority did not include
preservatives and many of these (59.1% overall), identified associations between these dyes and adverse effects
on neurobehavior with 10 of them reporting associations that were statistically significant [5, 7, 15–17].
Rowe and Rowe [17] saw a dose-response pattern
between increasing doses of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mg of
Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) per day and worsening behavioral scores. Only two other studies reported information on dose-response, one using multiple dyes and one
with Yellow No. 5 alone, with neither finding a clear
dose-response pattern [18, 19] However, Rowe and
Rowe used many more doses and had a larger sample
size than the other two studies. These differences and
other study design issues may have affected whether a
dose-response could be seen.

We could not divide studies based solely on age as
there was a wide range of ages studied with broad overlap
across studies reviewed. However, based on sensitivity
analyses examining age, in three studies, results varied minimally [11, 17, 20], while in three others, greater
effects were seen in younger participants [5, 14, 21].
Nigg et al., 2012 meta‑analysis

A high-quality meta-analysis [22] is supportive of the
hypothesis that synthetic food dye exposures is associated with adverse behavioral effects in children. This
study identified statistically significant summary associations for findings based on parent reports or on attention
tests, with effect sizes about one-sixth to one-third of
those seen for improvements from ADHD medications.
Nigg et al. estimated that 8% of children with ADHD
may have symptoms related to synthetic food dyes. Our
report evaluated the same studies used in the Nigg et al.
meta-analysis as well as two pilot or preliminary reports
[7, 19], two studies with only 1–2 participants [8, 16],
and a study published after the meta-analysis was published [10]. These five studies reported mixed results. It is
unlikely their inclusion in a meta-analysis would dramatically affect its results because most of these studies had
small sample sizes. Additionally, the Lok et al. study [23]
did not present means and standard deviations for analyses comparing placebo to artificial food dyes, and as such
would be difficult to include in meta-analysis with most
other studies.
Bias and confounding

As documented in Tables S.2-S.4 we performed extensive
evaluations of quality for each study. One strength of our
findings is that they are based on clinical trials with crossover designs and placebo control. Non-compliance can

be markedly reduced with the use of cross-over designs
since subjects are being compared to themselves. Bias that
may be introduced by the expectations of the researchers
and participants is minimized by use of blinding and placebo control. We performed a sensitivity analysis in which
we only included studies that were double-blinded and
had the cross-over randomized, and found that our conclusions were similar to that of our analysis that included
all studies (Table 2, rows for RCDP).

Recruitment strategies and participation rates were not
always clearly described in the studies, and most seemed
to involve convenience samples. The use of convenience
samples or low participation rates can introduce bias.
However, in studies in which the participants, parents,
and others were blinded, we found no clear evidence or
obvious reason that convenience sampling or low participation might cause false positive results. While convenience sampling and low participation rates might affect
the generalizability of some studies, we see no reason
why they would affect the ability of a study to examine whether at least some children might be adversely

affected by synthetic food dyes, especially given the
cross-over design.
Adjustments for publication bias by Nigg et al. [22]
attenuated summary effect sizes in the meta-analysis,
although several remained statistically significant. However, these adjustment methods are imperfect. In addition, given the widespread interest in the potential health
effects of synthetic food dyes, it seems unlikely that
well-conducted clinical trials would remain unpublished
resulting in publication bias.
Susceptibility

From the studies reviewed, it appears that not all children react to the dyes with adverse behavioral outcomes.
Possible explanations for this sensitivity are not clear.
Studies that included only children who were previously diagnosed with hyperactivity were not more likely
to report positive associations between synthetic food
dye exposure and poorer behavioral outcomes. Stevenson et al. [24] found that children (both 3 year-olds and
8/9 year-olds) with certain polymorphisms in histamine
degradation genes had greater adverse responses to synthetic food dyes. In addition, gene polymorphisms in the
dopamine transporter gene in 8/9 year-old children moderated the effects of the food dyes. Since histamine plays
a role as a neurotransmitter in the brain and is involved
in wakefulness, polymorphisms in the histamine degradation genes are a plausible basis for varied behavioral
sensitivity to dyes associated with histamine release. Replication of this study and further research of the impacts
of gene polymorphisms on response to food dyes are
needed.

Review of animal toxicology studies

Animal toxicology studies were used by FDA as the basis
for regulatory risk assessments of food dyes [25]. All current dye registrations were made between 1969 and 1986
based on studies performed 35 to 50 years ago. These
studies were not designed to assess neurobehavioral endpoints. Dye registration was accompanied by derivation
of an “acceptable daily intake” (ADI) based on these studies. FDA ADIs have not been updated since original dye
registration, although there have been several reviews of
specific effects since then, the latest in 2011 [25].
Our review of animal toxicology studies was intended
to examine neurobehavioral toxicity of food dyes and
included any study administering one or more of the FDA
registered food dyes and measuring a behavioral endpoint. We obtained 25 reports from the peer-reviewed
literature. Two reports could not be reviewed due to lack
of study information. The 23 studies reviewed had the
following characteristics:
• Rodent models (rats or mice)
• Oral administrations (diet or gavage)
• Dosing with individual dyes (14 studies) or dye mixtures (9 studies) (Fig. 2)
• Dosing included at or below that in studies used to
establish FDA ADIs
• Durations ranging from a single dose to lifetime daily
dosing (Fig. 3)
• Behavioral endpoints including preweaning motor
development, spontaneous motor activity and/or
learning and memory tests
• Comparison of dosed and control groups

Fig. 3 Experimental designs of developmental neurotoxicity studies in animals with synthetic food dye exposures

The study designs varied (Fig. 3) and included exposures during prenatal, infant, juvenile and adult life
stages, and examined neurobehavioral effects during
development and/or adulthood. Due to the wide range
of designs, an overall integration of findings was not possible but a broader picture of the potential for food dye
neurobehavioral toxicity is seen. Details of the studies are
presented in Table A.5 and A.6. Detailed evaluation and
interpretation of each study is reported in the OEHHA
document [1].First author and dates of publication are
shown.
Details from all the studies reviewed in this section are
shown in Table A.5.
Findings from these studies have greatly advanced our
knowledge of neurobehavioral effects of synthetic food
dyes:
• Long term consequences of exposure during pregnancy [26–29]. This is the first research using the
classical developmental neurotoxicology (DNT)
design where exposure begins during pregnancy to
identify long-term effects of perinatal exposure. Prior

regulatory developmental toxicology studies have
been limited to effects on mortality, malformation,
and growth. There are no studies in humans using
exposure in pregnancy.
Effects of synthetic food dyes on behavior in adult
rats after a single administration [30, 31]. These are
the only available animal studies measuring behavior
shortly after a single dye administration.
Behavioral effects when synthetic food dyes are
administered at juvenile/adolescent life stages [32,
33]
Effects on behavior in adult rodents with chronic
exposures [31, 34–36]. Due to the emphasis on
behavioral effects in children, more general studies of
neurobehavioral toxicity in adults have been lacking
but have recently been undertaken in animal models.
Prevention of effects of synthetic food dyes on behavior by antioxidants [35, 36]. This line of investigation
has also been pursued for other aspects of dye toxicity [37–45]
Brain changes associated with behavioral effects [26,
29–31, 34–36]. Emerging research in the last 10 years

Miller et al. Environmental Health

(2022) 21:45

has begun to explore effects of synthetic food dye
exposures on the brain at doses that affect behavior.
Individual dye studies

A series of neurobehavioral studies of individual dyes has
been performed by one laboratory in Japan for 5 of the
7 food dyes approved for use in the US [46–51]. These
studies used lifetime exposure beginning prior to parental mating. Details of the studies can be found in Table
A.5. For three of the dyes, behavioral effects were identified at doses below those producing the toxicological
effects used to establish the FDA ADIs. Several considerations limit the use of these studies in assessing food
dye risk to children, including reproductive toxicity in the
studies, multiple life stage exposure, dosing both before
and during testing, and lack of litter-based statistics for
preweaning endpoints.
Eight studies were from US laboratories, all published
prior to 1987. We did not find any programmatic investigator-initiated research on neurobehavioral effects of
food dyes currently being performed in the US.
The US FDA supported early studies of three synthetic
food dyes (Yellow No. 5, Red No. 3, Red No. 40) that also
used lifetime exposures beginning prior to or shortly
after conception and continuing through adult animal
testing [52–54]. Dosing was based on known non-behavioral toxicity of the dyes. Behavioral effects were reported
for Red No. 3 [54] and Red No. 40 [53] using an extensive
test battery.
The other 5 studies of individual dyes were conducted
more recently and administered individual dyes to postpubertal (adolescent and adult) rodents [30, 31, 34–36].
These investigators were interested in specific hypotheses
about food dye mechanism of action and included brain
assays: brain microhistomorphometry [35, 36]; measures
of oxidative stress [34]; and measures of influence on the
serotonin system [30, 31].
Mixture studies

Early studies used dye mixtures designed to parallel US
food dye exposure at that time [33, 55–58]. More recent
studies used dosing based on a multiple of regulatory
ADIs [27–29, 32]. Study details are presented in Table
A.6. Animal mixture studies, like children’s mixture studies, are valuable for hazard identification, but not for ADI
development, which is based on each dye individually.
The two studies using synthetic food dye mixtures that
are most relevant to the studies in children reported
behavioral effect during dye administration to immature
rats [32, 33]. Both studies reported effects on regulation
of spontaneous motor activity. Shaywitz et al. [33] used
a mixture based on human exposure and found greater

Page 9 of 19

activity in rats dosed at twice the estimated average exposure at that time in children. Erickson et al. [32] found
increased movement time using a mixture of dyes in
drinking water, each dye at a dose less than 2 times the
FDA ADI.
One series of studies examined exposure to a mixture
of synthetic food dyes during pregnancy [27–29]. The 9
dyes were administered at either the JECFA ADI [28] or
100 times the JECFA ADI [27, 29]. Six of the seven FDA
registered food dyes were included. Effects on activity and emotionality were reported with testing of onemonth old (early adolescence) and three-month old
(adulthood) offspring, but learning and memory tests
were not affected.
Behavioral endpoints

Behavioral assessments were primarily conducted in a
few domains: preweaning motor development (4 studies),
spontaneous motor activity (21 studies), and trial-based
learning and memory tests (18 studies). Some recent
studies included emotionality tests [27–29, 32].
Spontaneous motor activity, a sensitive and widely used
test in developmental neurotoxicology, was the most frequently used test in animal dye studies because of the
findings of hyperactivity in children’s studies. While the
test apparatus and specific endpoints affected (vertical/
horizontal activity, speed, distance, duration) varied,
altered regulation of activity was seen in 17 of the 21 of
the studies.
Sensitivity of learning and memory tests in developmental neurotoxicology is less consistent [59, 60]. For
the food dye studies we examined, tests included shockmotivated avoidance, food motivated mazes, and water
mazes, with 12 of 18 studies reporting dye effects. Our
review found that many of the test results could not be
used for risk assessment due to design and statistical
issues. For example, some studies did not use litter-based
statistics.
Brain assays in behavioral studies

Many animal studies we reviewed conducted brain assays
that evaluated a number of parameters with a focus on
neurotransmitter systems. Early studies did not identify
effects of synthetic food dye exposures on tissue catecholamine neurotransmitter concentrations [33, 55–57].
More recent studies identified effects on gene receptor
expression, enzyme activity in neurotransmitter systems, and localized changes in neurotransmitter levels
[26, 29–31]. Also, brain histomorphology assessed with
contemporary methods has identified effects (decreased
medial prefrontal cortex volume, decreased numbers of
glia and neurons, changes in dendritic morphology) of
the two most used food dyes, Red No. 40 and Yellow No.

Miller et al. Environmental Health

(2022) 21:45

5 [35, 36]. Protective effects of antioxidants [35, 36], as
well as changes in brain anti-oxidant defense systems [34]
provide evidence for oxidative stress as a mechanism of
toxicity. Two other papers with no behavioral measures
found markers of oxidative stress in the brain after in vivo
treatment of rats with Yellow No. 5 [61, 62].
Data from a human study provide evidence for a
mechanism involving the neurotransmitter histamine.
The investigators demonstrated that polymorphisms in
the histamine degradation gene for histamine-N-methyltransferase influences response to a dye mixture [24].
In addition to its role in the inflammatory process, histamine is recognized for its role in regulating synaptic
transmission alone and in concert with other neurotransmitters [2].
Considering both in vivo and in vitro research, other
potential pathways for food dye neurotoxicity have been
suggested [63–65].
• Endocrine (thyroid, estrogen) mediated effects
• Interference with neuronal proliferation and differentiation
• Effects secondary to general physiological toxicity
• Immune mediated effects
• Interference with nutrient bioavailability
The relevance of the animal toxicology findings to
humans ingesting synthetic food dyes in food and medications would be better understood with more information about food dye toxicokinetics. In particular, the
breakdown of azo dyes in the gut prior to absorption
requires toxicological examination of metabolites. Future
studies should evaluate whether the parent compounds
act on the gut to influence behavior via the gut-brain axis
[66].
Hazard characterization

The studies that form the basis of the FDA (and JECFA)
ADIs are many decades old and as such were not capable of detecting the types of neurobehavioral outcomes
measured in later animal studies, or in clinical trials in
children consuming synthetic food dyes.
Nonetheless, OEHHA first compared the US FDA
ADIs and the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Levels
(NOAELs) from which they were derived to NOAELs
from the animal toxicology studies that were reviewed
[1]. Next, we compared the estimated food dye exposures (mg/kg/d) from food consumption to available
regulatory benchmarks in a traditional Hazard Index
approach for noncancer health effects. The Hazard
Index approach divides estimated exposures by a toxicity benchmark. If that ratio is greater than 1, then

Page 10 of 19

it is indicative of a possible risk of adverse noncancer
effects. Finally, we compared the ADIs to NOAELs and
Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Levels (LOAELs)
observed in the few key animal and human studies of
sufficient quality. This comparison should help inform
future revisions of the ADIs aimed at protecting children from neurobehavioral effects.
Comparing neurobehavioral effect levels to FDA ADI NOAELs

To derive the ADI for each dye, US FDA divided NOAELs
reported by investigators from animal studies by a factor
of 100. While reviewing animal neurobehavioral toxicology studies, we compared the effective doses (LOAELs)
to animal NOAELs used by US FDA to derive human
ADIs (hereinafter referred to as ADI NOAELs). The purpose of this comparison was to see if neurobehavioral
effects were found at doses that FDA determined were
not causing effects in the older general toxicology studies. Tables 3 and 4 presents these comparisons for both
developmental and adult neurotoxicology studies where a
single dye was administered.
Comparing food dye exposures to available regulatory
benchmarks

OEHHA [1] derived exposure estimates based on
NHANES 2015–2016 Dietary Interview data, and information on food dye concentration data sourced from
Doell et al. [67]. We calculated single-day and two-day
average cumulative daily synthetic food dye intake estimates (mg/person/day) for the following demographic
categories:
• Pregnant women 18 years and older
• Women of childbearing age (18–49 years)
• Children: 0- < 2 years, 2- < 5 years, 5- < 9 years,
9- < 16 years, and 16–18 years
We estimated daily synthetic food dye intakes (mg/person/day) for
• The typical-exposure scenario, which represents
exposure to a given FD&C batch-certified synthetic
food dye for a typical consumer, an individual who
may not always eat products with the lowest or highest levels of that food dye but some combination of
both.
• The high-exposure scenario, which represents the
highest exposure where the individual is only consuming products with the highest levels of that food
dye.
We divided each individual’s FD&C batch-certified synthetic food dye intake estimate (mg/person/day) by their

Calculated by OEHHA using standard assumptions about food intake and body weight

body weight (kg) reported in NHANES 2015–16 [68] to
produce synthetic food dye dose estimates in units of
mg/kg/day. The most commonly consumed dyes for the
various age ranges of children expressed as the mean
of typical-exposure scenario estimates were Red No. 40
(ranged from 0.11 to 0.3 mg/kg-day), Red No. 3 (ranged
0.02 to 0.54 mg/kg-d), Yellow No. 5 (ranged from 0.05
to 0.19 mg/kg-d) and Yellow No. 6. (ranged from 0.05–
0.20 mg/kg-d) [1]. The 95th percentile of the high-exposure scenario estimates ranged from about 1 to 8 mg/
kg-day for these four dyes. Children’s exposures tended
to be higher than adult women.
We compared the synthetic food dye dose estimates
to the US FDA and JECFA ADIs (Table 5) by calculating
the ratio of the dose estimates to the established ADIs
[25, 69–72] as the Hazard Index. Hazard index > 1 signifies that the food dye exposure estimates (mg/kg/day)
exceeded the established ADI.
With the exception of FD&C Red No. 3, all exposure estimates (mg/kg/day) from foods were below the
US FDA or JECFA ADIs. The Hazard Indices (HI) that
exceeded 1 for Red No. 3 are bolded in Table 6. Children’s
single day mean FD&C Red No. 3 exposure estimates for
typical- and high-exposure scenarios ranged from 0.01 to
0.60, not exceeding the FDA ADI of 2.5 mg/kg-day. The

95th percentile exposure estimates ranged up to 3.16
(although it represents few children). For several age categories the mean single day typical- and high-exposure
scenarios exceeded the JECFA ADI of 0.1 mg/kg-day,
with HI ranging from 0.21 to 15; the 0 < 2 year age category had the highest HI.
Comparing US FDA ADIs to key neurobehavioral studies

There are several animal studies and one human study
that could be used to evaluate whether existing ADIs are
protective of neurobehavioral effects for Red No. 3, Red
No. 40, Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6. No suitable studies of green or blue dyes were found for this comparison.
Red no. 3 Tanaka et al. [48] conducted a developmental toxicity study of Red No. 3 where various doses were
administered via diet from preconception through PND
63 and reported increased activity measurements in
female offspring. For adult female dams, more turning
was reported in the high-dose group than in controls.
Activity in male offspring was affected at 3 weeks of age
(p < 0.01 for linear dose trend), but not at 8 weeks of age.
In the female offspring at 8 weeks, statistically significant
dose-dependent dye-induced increases in activity were
seen, but not at 3 weeks of age. These included number

JECFA presents their ADIs as a range from 0 to a positive value

of activity bouts, distance traveled in each bout, greater
speed, total time moving and total distance. This interesting finding of greater activity is particularly valuable
because of the absence of more severe developmental
toxicity.
The NOAEL was 24 mg/kg/day for the female offspring.
This NOAEL is a factor of 10 higher than the FDA ADI of
2.5 mg/kg/day. If one were to apply the same methodology as US FDA (dividing the NOAEL by a factor of 100)
to derive an ADI, the resulting ADI would be a factor of
10 lower.

changes, and on behavioral changes in young adult animals either following single gavage administration or
following 15 or 30 day exposures to Red No. 3. In their
first study, the investigators measured activity (vertical rearing frequency detected automatically) for 5 min
at 30 to 60 min intervals up to 9 h post-dosing after single gavage doses of 0, 1, 10, 100 or 200 mg/kg. A dosedependent pattern of diminished activity was observed
that reached a low at 2 h after dye administration and
then returned to baseline by 7 h (Fig. 1 in Dalal and Poddar (2009)). The effect of diminished activity was replicated in an experiment demonstrating reversal of this
effect by inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO), the
enzyme that metabolizes serotonin. In the second report,
the investigators administered the same doses daily for
a period of 15 or 30 days and activity was measured following the last administration. Following the 15 or 30 day
treatments, activity was increased rather than decreased
in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1 in Dalal and Poddar
(2010)). One explanation for these contrasting results is
the role of two neuronal corticotrophin releasing factor
(CRF) receptors that determine an active versus passive
response to stress [73]. The NOAEL from these studies is 1 mg/kg/day based on changes in vertical activity in male rats, on increased serotonin levels in specific
brain regions, and increased plasma cortisone levels. The
NOAEL of 1 mg/kg/day in these studies is lower than
the FDA ADI of 2.5 mg/kg/day. If one were to use a 100fold safety factor with this NOAEL, the ADI would be
0.01 mg/kg/day.
Red no. 40 and yellow no. 5 Noorafshan et al. [35]
administered Red No. 40 to adult male rats (N = 10 per
dose group) at doses of 0, 7, or 70 mg/kg/day (Table A.6)
with and without 200 mg/kg/day of the anti-inflammatory
molecule taurine, by gavage for 6 weeks. Both Red No. 40
treated groups performed more reference memory errors
and working memory errors in the radial arm maze than
controls (p < 0.01). Taurine administration mitigated this
effect. Histomorphology and stereology found that, in the
high dose Red No. 40 group, the medial prefrontal cortex
volume was smaller, and there were fewer neurons and
glial cells in this brain area. Interpretation of these results
is somewhat complicated by the lack of information on
body weight and brain weight. The LOAEL is 7 mg/kg/
day for this study, which is the same as the US FDA and
JECFA ADI of 7 mg/kg/day.
These investigators used the same protocol to evaluate
the effect of another azo dye, Yellow No. 5 [36]. Adult
male rats (N = 10 per dose group) were gavaged with Yellow No. 5 at 0, 5, or 50 mg/kg/day for 7 weeks with and

Page 14 of 19

without vitamin E. Exploration time in the novel object
test was decreased at the high dose (p < 0.01). More days
were required for Yellow No. 5 treated rats (low- and
high-dose groups were combined) to reach the learning
criterion in the radial arm maze test, and more errors
occurred during the learning and retention phases.
The brain assays demonstrated a smaller volume of the
medial prefrontal cortex in the high-dose group, and
lower cell count and shorter dendrites with lower spine
density at both doses; qualitative alterations in cell shape
were described. These effects were ameliorated by concomitant administration of the antioxidant vitamin E.
The LOAEL was 5 mg/kg/day, based on morphometry,
the same as the US FDA ADI of 5 mg/kg/day and lower
than the JECFA ADI of 10 mg/kg/day. If this study were
to be used as the basis for setting an ADI, the resulting
ADI would be considerably lower than the existing ADI.
Changes in the medial prefrontal cortex can be directly
related to the cognitive performance of the animals, as
this part of the rodent brain is involved in spatial memory, decision-making and attention [35, 74], and may predict similar effects in children.
One study in children used several doses and demonstrated a dose response effect on behavioral scores
for Yellow No. 5 [17]. For this study, the investigators
recruited 34 children whose parents had brought them to
the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne to be evaluated for hyperactivity and 20 children whose parents had
no concern about behavior. The children, ranging in age
from 2 to 14 years, were enrolled in a double blind, placebo-controlled repeated measures study of the effects
of Yellow No. 5 on behavioral score. The investigators
developed a Behavioral Rating Inventory for this study
that included 11 items measuring irritability, 9 items that
measured sleep disturbance, 4 items that measured restlessness, 3 items that measured aggression and 3 items
that measured attention span. In addition, the investigators also used the Conners 10-item Abbreviated ParentTeacher Questionnaire to assess behavior, which focuses
on attention related problems. Children were placed on a
dye-free diet for at least 6 weeks before the trial, and then
given doses (randomly) of 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 mg Yellow
No. 5 with 2 days in between each dosing. Parents rated
the behavior daily using the two instruments.
The investigators found 24 children who had significant
behavioral responses to dye challenge, based on ranking the behavioral scores for the six dye-challenge days
paired with a set of placebo days; these children were
labelled as reactors. The mean behavioral scores on dyechallenge days were significantly different than the scores
for the placebo (day before) challenge for all dose/placebo

Miller et al. Environmental Health

(2022) 21:45

pairs (p < 0.05) in the reactors, while the nonreactors
showed random fluctuations in behavioral scores. Using
repeated measures ANOVA on the six dye-challenge
scores with reactors and nonreactors as the betweengroups factor, the authors report a significant betweengroups effect (p < 0.001). There was a dose-dependent
effect and the mean score difference between the reactor
and the nonreactor groups were significant at doses of
2 mg and higher (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in mean behavioral rating between the groups
on the placebo days. OEHHA identifies 1 mg tartrazine as
a NOAEL. The children ranged from 2 to 14 years, with a
mean of 7 years. To determine a NOAEL dosage, OEHHA
divided the NOAEL of 1 mg by a reference body weight
of 25.5 kg for the mean age of 7 years (US EPA, 2011,
Table 8–10, based on NHANES 1988–1994); a NOAEL
dosage of 0.04 mg/kg/day is obtained. This NOAEL is
more than 100-fold lower than the US FDA ADI for Yellow No. 5 of 5 mg/kg/day.
While not all of the human trials demonstrated effects
of mixtures of food dyes or of Yellow No. 5 on behavior, the findings of Rowe and Rowe [17] are supported
by some of the other clinical trials in children (Table 7).
Note that in all these studies, effects were observed at
estimated doses lower than the US FDA ADI for Yellow No. 5 of 5 mg/kg/day. One study [9] reports that in
a six-week open trial of the Feingold diet in 55 subjects,
ages 3 to 15 years, who had been suspected of reacting to
food dyes, 40 children demonstrated improvement when
on the Feingold diet, based on assessment of attention
span, activity level, distractability, frustration tolerance,
and social and manipulative skills by therapists, and
teacher and parent questionnaires. In the same study, 8
of the children were challenged with Yellow No. 5 using
a double-blinded cross-over design, and two of these
children were observed to exhibit strong behavioral
responses to the dye. Based on reference body weights
for children ages 3 to 15 years, the dosages employed in
that study [9] would have been 0.9–2.7 mg/kg/day. In a
double-blind crossover study of 22 children, 4 to 8 years

Page 15 of 19

of age, both objective tests for attention and parent and
teacher ratings (Conners Parent Teacher Rating Scale)
were administered before and after a 4 week dye-free
diet, after a 2 week Yellow No. 5 (5 mg daily) challenge
and after a 4 week washout dye-free diet [7]. The investigators report statistically significant effects of Yellow
No. 5 based on parental ratings in a subgroup of children whose mothers had reported improved behavior
while on the elimination diet. The dose for this range
of ages and body weights to the children would be 0.2
to 0.3 mg/kg/day. Levy and Hobbs [75] reported that
mothers’ ratings using the Conners scale were an average of 13% lower when children (N = 8) ate placebo
cookies compared to those containing Yellow No. 5, in
a 2 week crossover trial with daily ratings by parents for
a 3 h period after eating the cookies. While there were
no statistically significant differences noted, the authors
reported that this effect “just failed to reach the .05 level
of significance”. The dose of Yellow No. 5 in this study
was about 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg/day.
Taken together, these studies provide support for an
effect of Yellow No. 5 on behavior and for use of a neurobehavioral endpoint to determine a safe level of exposure for Yellow No. 5 to protect children who respond to
this food dye.
Yellow no. 6 There is only one study of Yellow No. 6
with neurobehavioral endpoints [47]. Some neurobehavioral effects in offspring were reported for preweaning
development and maze learning, but it was not possible
to draw firm conclusions due to the statistical approach
and varying group sizes in the study.
Goldenring et al. demonstrated that sulfanilic acid (1 mg/
kg/day I.p.), a common metabolite of the azo food dyes
Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6, increased activity in pups
following direct administration assessed three times during a treatment extending throughout juvenile development [55].

Honohan et al. reported gastrointestinal absorption of
sulfanilic acid of 37.4% [76, 77]. The 1 mg/kg intraperitoneal dose of sulfanilic acid used by Goldenring et al.
would be equivalent to 2.7 mg/kg produced in the gastrointestinal tract, which in turn would result from metabolism of 7 mg/kg of orally administered Yellow No. 5.
Thus, one could view 7 mg/kg−/day of Yellow No. 6 to be
a free-standing LOAEL. This LOAEL is about twice the
FDA (3.75 mg/kg/day) and JECFA (4 mg/kg/day) ADIs
for Yellow No. 6. The study by Goldenring et al. [55] indicates the ADIs for Yellow No. 6 may not be adequately
protective of neurobehavioral effects.

Discussion
Current evidence from studies in humans, largely from
controlled exposure studies in children, supports a
relationship between food dye exposure and adverse
behavioral outcomes in children, both with and without
pre-existing behavioral disorders. There appears to be
considerable interindividual variability in the sensitivity to synthetic food dyes. While there were a range of
results in the studies we identified, the majority reported
at least some evidence of an association, including higher
quality studies. Importantly, none of the factors we examined (e.g., parent vs teacher report, publication year,
validated outcome metric) explained the majority of the
heterogeneity seen across the study results. For example,
although a large fraction of the studies published since
1990 reported statistically significant results (5 of 6 challenge studies), many studies published before 1990 also
reported statistically significant results (8 of 19). And,
while studies using a validated outcome metric were
more likely to report associations, several studies without
validated outcome metrics reported similar associations.
Despite the various study limitations, we were unable to
identify strong evidence for any apparent biases or other
factors that invalidated the positive results reported in
the literature.
Studies of Yellow No. 5 alone provide evidence that
this dye affects children’s behavior. Most of the challenge
studies involved administering multiple dyes at the same
time so no single offending agent could be identified from
those studies. Regardless, studies involving mixtures
more closely represent real-life scenarios, where most
children are exposed to multiple dyes in a single day.
Importantly, impacts on behavior and/or neurotransmitter systems or cellular architecture in the brain have
been observed in animal studies. Several studies examining exposures during development, during pregnancy
only, or as adolescents or adults reported changes in
activity using a variety of metrics either in the offspring
or in the adolescent or adult animals. In utero exposure

Page 16 of 19

was observed to have behavioral effects in the adult offspring. Thus, the animal literature provides support for
behavioral effects of synthetic food dyes, including those
most often consumed.
Taken together, the scientific literature supports an
effect of synthetic food dye exposures on neurobehavior
in children at environmentally relevant exposure levels.
Comparing estimated exposures we derived from the
2015–16 NHANES dietary interview to the FDA and
JECFA ADIs revealed that for most dyes we analyzed,
exposures do not exceed the ADIs. The exception is Red
No. 3, where the Hazard Index based on the mean ranged
up to 15 for the youngest age groups (Table 6).
Comparisons of the effective doses in some of the animal studies that measured behavioral or brain effects
following exposure to synthetic food dyes indicates that
the basis of the FDA ADIs are not adequate to protect
neurobehavior in susceptible children. Three of the studies using developmental exposures reported LOAELS
that were below the NOAEL that was used for the FDA
ADI. Almost all studies in mature animals that measured
behavioral changes and/or changes in the brain found
effects of the synthetic food dyes at doses lower than
the NOAELs used by the US FDA for the derivation of
the ADIs. Several studies observe effects on behavior in
animals at doses close to or even lower than the existing
FDA ADIs. As noted above, the animal studies that form
the basis of the FDA ADIs were not capable of detecting
the types of neurobehavioral outcomes observed in many
human challenge studies.
For four of the dyes with adequate animal studies
explicitly reporting neurobehavioral effects, applying
results from these studies would result in lower ADIs and
likely exceedances of those ADIs from typical food consumption by children. Consumption of over-the-counter
medications and vitamins adds to the exposure from
foods [78, 79].
If the ADI for Yellow No. 5 were based on the one study
that evaluated a dose-response in children for behavioral
effects, the ADI would be considerably lower. The human
challenge studies provide support for an effect of Yellow
No. 5 on behavior and for use of a neurobehavioral endpoint to determine a safe level of exposure for Yellow No.
5 to protect children who respond to this food dye.
It is not possible to compare the results of the animal
or human mixtures studies to an ADI for a single dye.
However, Erikson et al. [32] reported increased activity in male rats administered synthetic food dye mixtures where each dye was given at less than twice the
ADI NOAEL. Shaywitz et al. [33] and Goldenring et al.
[56] found greater activity and decreased habituation
in a rodent model following administration of mixtures
at doses near the ADIs. These mixture doses are in the

Miller et al. Environmental Health

(2022) 21:45

range of doses in human mixture studies. Doses used
in the human mixture studies were designed to mimic
actual exposures in children.
A broad range of potential mechanisms by which the
synthetic food dyes may impact behavior in susceptible
children have been proposed. Additional research is warranted including:
• Animal testing in immature animals that includes a
within-subjects design and measures of neurobehavior more similar to those in the human studies.
• Studies of the toxicokinetics of food dyes in humans
and animals using modern techniques and including
exposures during different life stages.
• Mechanistic studies and studies of underlying genetic
susceptibility.
• Additional adequately powered clinical trials in children of the FD&C batch-certified synthetic food dyes
with a cross-over, placebo-controlled, double blinded
design utilizing validated outcome measures, inclusion of behavioral assessments by parents, and objective tests of attention and other behavioral measures
by trained psychometricians. Such studies should
attempt to evaluate whether the response differs by
age, gender, ethnicity, race, or socioeconomic status
through a design that evaluates dosing on a mg/kg/
day basis.
• Studies that evaluate the potential long-term impacts
of repeated exposures to food dyes in children.
Such research would provide additional data to inform
appropriate acceptable daily intakes that explicitly protect children from neurobehavioral effects. In the shortterm, the neurobehavioral effects of synthetic food dyes
in children should be acknowledged and steps taken to
reduce exposure to these dyes in potentially susceptible
children.
